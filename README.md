# Arduino_Uno_Based_LUXMETER
In this project, prototype provides to measure light level and It enables the LED to turn on and off according to the light level. You can reach arduino ide cods and circuit diagram from this respiratory. For this project I used Arduino Uno,LCD display, LDR, LED, potantiometer, resistors(10k,330ohm and 470ohm)
